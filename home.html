                <h2> Belmont's Porchfest is a celebration of community through arts and music performed by your friends and neighbors in yards and on porches throughout Belmont. Bike to a friend's house to hear a klezmer band or host a circus show on your front lawn!</h2> This year we had quite the event! Despite a torrential downpour, more than 2300 people showed up for the fun at 58 porches hosting 80 groups comprised of a total of 483 adults and 118 students.
